# analysis

This directory contains the current versions of all the data files that I use for my end-of-the-line analyses in R.

## To Do

- [ ] update rMarkdown files in workflows so that they run in this repo
- [ ] populate the readme in the data subdirectory

## Contents

### data

This directory contains all of the count dataframes, rate matricies, and other data types I use to do most of my downstream analyses.  There's a readme in this subdirectory which contains more detail about my file types and organization.

### R_code

Here, I've kept all the extra scripts and functions I've written in R to help me carry out my analyses.  The subdirectory 'data_wrangling' contains mostly data processing and formatting scripts, while the main directory mostly contains testing and plotting functions.

### workflows_active

This directory contains mostly work in progress.  Enter at your own risk.

### workflows_finished

This directory contains rmarkdowns and knitted pdfs of the most central components of my paper.
