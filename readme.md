# mutation_rate

This repo contains all of the code and essential raw data
for replicating the central results of my report on differences
in polymorphism patterns across populations

## helper_code

The majority of my workhorse python and shell scripts can be found here.
The subdirectory 'ref_files' contains text files for 3mer, 5mer, and 7mer,
detailing the subcontexts that correspond to each possible polymorphism/mutation
type.

## nc_bedfiles

bedfiles containing noncoding regions from Aggarwalla and Voight, 2016.
These were used as the inclusion regions for the 1,000 genomes vcf files we analyzed.
nc_X_regions.bed contains just the noncoding regions on the X chromosome that we used.
