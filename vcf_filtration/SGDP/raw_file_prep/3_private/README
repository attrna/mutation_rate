# private SGDP files

The files in this directory were generated by running SGDP_bcftools_isec.sh (which can be found in the directory above this one) for each population and each chromosome.  RCA manually checked that the chromosome 22 output file was correct by examining the firs ~10 lines of each file compared with the original "all_snps" file.

NOTE: SGDP_bcftools_isec is meant to be run in the directory `../2_filtered`, relative to this one.
