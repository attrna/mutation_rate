# Weird tabix files

For some reason the tabix files in this directory are older than the vcfs with which they are associated.  I noticed this on 8/28/2017 as I was rerunning my filtration steps due to the truncation of several files.  These vcfs were retabixed and the downstream filtration steps rerun.
